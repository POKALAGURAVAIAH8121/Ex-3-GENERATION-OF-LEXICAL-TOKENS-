# Ex-3 GENERATION OF LEXICAL TOKENS USING C
# AIM
## To write a C program to implement lexical analyzer to recognize a few patterns.
# ALGORITHM 
1)	Start the program.
2)	Get the input from the user with the terminating symbol ‘;’.
3)	Until the symbol is ‘;’, do the following:
   
    a.	If the next character of the symbol is an operator then print it as an operator.
  	
    b.	If the next character of the symbol is a variable, then insert it into symbol table and print it as an identifier.
  	
    c.	If the next character of the symbol is a bracket, then print it as parenthesis.
  	
5)	Stop the program.
# PROGRAM
# OUTPUT
